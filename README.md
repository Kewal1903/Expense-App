# Expense-App
Front-end mini project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The app contains options to add expenses, tabulate them and calculate the total expenditure. The expenses can be classified into different types and the user can analyze them using graphs (Chart.js). The UI contains a dark/light mode option and is simple and user friendly. The app uses Local Storage to store data (future scope for back-end integration).
